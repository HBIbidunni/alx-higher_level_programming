# ALX Project: Python - Almost a circle
--------
This project is a prelude to the <b>AirBnB project</b> in Python and its fundermental and key learnings center on:

* Unit testing and how it is implemented in a large project.
* How to serialize and deserialize a Class.
* The writing and reading of a JSON file.
* What is `*args` and how to use it.
* What is `**kwargs` and how to use it.
* The handling of named arguments in a function.

## Project Requirements:

<b> A) Python Scripts</b>

* All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
* All files should end with a new line.
* The first line of all files should be exactly <b>#!/usr/bin/python3</b>.
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
* All codes should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.).
* All files must be executable.
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
* All your modules should be documented: <b>python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'</b>.
* All your classes should be documented: <b>python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'</b>.
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented: <b>python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'</b> and <b>python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'</b>.


> A <b>documentation</b> is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified).


<b> B) Python Unit Tests</b>

* All files end with a new line.
* All test files are inside a folder tests.
* You have to use the unittest module.
* All test files should be python files (extension: .py).
* All your test files and folders should start with test_
* Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base.py.
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: <b>python3 -m unittest discover tests</b>.
* You can also test file by file by using this command: <b>python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py</b>.
