# The ALX Project: 0x11. Python - Network #1
-------------

This project "__0x11. Python - Network #1__" forms an essential part of the curriculum at ALX. The focus of the project is on __network programming__ using __Python__.

## Project Requirements :briefcase:

- All files are written in __Python__.
- All __Python scripts__ must be __executable__.
- The first line of all Python files should be __#!/usr/bin/python3__.
- Use the __PEP 8__ style guide for __Python__ code.
- All __modules__ should be documented with __Python docstrings__.
- Use the __requests module__ for sending __HTTP__ requests.

Similarly, the __core of this project__ centers on:

- What a URL is
- What HTTP is
- How to read a URL
- The scheme for a HTTP URL
- What a domain name is
- What a sub-domain is
- How to define a port number in a URL
- What a query string is
- What an HTTP request is
- What an HTTP response is
- What HTTP headers are
- What the HTTP message body is
- What an HTTP request method is
- What an HTTP response status code is
- What an HTTP Cookie is
- How to make a request with cURL
- What happens when you type google.com in your browser(`Application level`) 

## 5 Project tasks descriptions :thought_balloon: :page_with_curl: :writing_hand:

-- The following examples form a part of the tasks in this project:


0. __What's my status? #0__
Write a Python script that fetches __https://intranet.hbtn.io/status__

- You must use the package requests.
- You are not allowed to import any other packages than requests.


1. __Response header value #0__
Write a Python script that takes in a URL, sends a request to the URL, and displays the value of the X-Request-Id variable found in the header of the response.

- You must use the packages requests and sys.
- You are not allowed to import any other packages than requests and sys.
- The value of this variable is different for each request.
- You don't need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type).

2. __POST an email #0__
Write a Python script that takes in a URL and an email address, sends a POST request to the passed URL with the email as a parameter, and finally displays the body of the response.


- The email must be sent in the email variable.
- You must use the packages requests and sys.
- You are not allowed to import any other packages than requests and sys.
- You don't need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type).

3. __Error code #0__
Write a Python script that takes in a URL, sends a request to the URL, and displays the body of the response.


- If the HTTP status code is greater than or equal to 400, print Error code: followed by the value of the HTTP status code.
- You must use the packages requests and sys.
- You are not allowed to import any other packages than requests and sys.
- You don't need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type).

4. __What's my status? #1__
Write a Python script that fetches __https://intranet.hbtn.io/status__.


- You must use the package requests.
- You are not allowed to import any other packages than requests.


5. __Response header value #1__

- You must use the packages requests and sys.
- You are not allowed to import any other packages than requests and sys.
