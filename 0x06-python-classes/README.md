# Python - Classes and Objects
--------

* In this project, the focus is on `object oriented programming`or (`OOP`) for short which is another way of organizing programs to combine data and functionality and wrap it inside an `object`. It differs from the procedure-oriented way of programming which designs programs around blocks of statements that manipulate data. 

* The two main aspects of `OOP` are `classes` and `objects`. A `class` creates a new `type` where `objects` are `instances` of the class. For instance, a variables of type `int` which translates to saying that variables that store integers are variables which are instances (`objects`) of the `int` class.

* All solutions to the ALX project `0x06. Python - Classes and Objects` are written above. Your comments on my code would be highly appreciated.
