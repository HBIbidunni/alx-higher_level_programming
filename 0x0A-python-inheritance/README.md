# ALX Project: Python - Inheritance.

* In this project, the emphasis is on inheritance, multiple inheritance and their purpose.
* Inheritance is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) languages.
* it is a mechanism  that allows you to create a hierarchy of classes that share a set of properties and methods by deriving a class from another class.
* All cases of multiple inheritance exhibit one or more dynamic ordering or diamond relationships (where at least one of the parent classes can be accessed through multiple paths from the bottommost class).
* What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type and super built-in functions.
