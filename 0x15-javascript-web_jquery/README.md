# The ALX Project: 0x15. JavaScript - Web jQuery
----------

The __0x15. JavaScript - Web jQuery project__ is part of the curriculum at __ALX__. 
In this project, I learned about __jQuery__, a __fast__, __small__, and __feature-rich JavaScript library__ that simplifies 
__HTML document traversal__ and __manipulation__, __event handling__, and __animation__. 

## Project Description :briefcase::heavy_check_mark:

The __0x15. JavaScript - Web jQuery project__ focuses on introducing and mastering __jQuery library__ concepts. 
This includes __DOM manipulation__, __event handling__, __animations__, and __AJAX requests__. 
The project aims to enhance the understanding of __web development__ by utilizing the power and simplicity of __jQuery__.

* __0-script.js__: JavaScript script that updates the text color of the HTML tag HEADER to red (#FF0000).
