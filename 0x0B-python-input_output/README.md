# ALX Project: Python - Input/Output
---------

* Here, I gained significant knowledge on reading and writing files, `JSON` encoder and decoder and what `py-file I/O` is all about.

## Project Requirements

* All files are interpreted/compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using <b>python3 (version 3.8.5)</b>
* All files end with a new line.
* The first line of all files are exactly <b>#!/usr/bin/python3.</b>
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* All code use the <b>pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)</b>
* All files are executable.
* The files lenght are tested using `wc`.

> All comments and feedbacks on my codes are welcome. Kindly take a look.
