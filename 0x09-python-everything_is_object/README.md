# The ALX Project solutions to : 0x09. Python - Everything is object
------------

## Instructions on the ALX Project

* This project is a little bit different than the usual projects.
* The first part is only questions about Python’s specificity like “What would be the result of…”. You should read all documentation first (as usual :)), 
* Then take the time to think and brainstorm with peers about what you think and why. Try to do this without coding anything for a few hours.


> It’s important that you truly understand the reasons behind the answers of all those tasks so that you can apply the same logic to other variables and other variable types.

> <b>Note that during interviews for Python positions, you will most likely have to answer to these type of questions.</b>

> All your answers should be only one line in a file. No space before or after the answer.

* All feedbacks,comments and suggestions on my codes are highly welcome. Please take a look.
